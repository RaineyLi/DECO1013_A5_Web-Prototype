                        <p>The  past  few  months  have  been  an  uncertain  and  difficult  time  around  the  world, as we collectively respond to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
                          In India, a nation-wide lockdown has been in place since late March and was recently extended until the end of May. In April, children at Prema Vasam lit earthen lamps together to participate in a National Vigil held for 9 minutes at 9pm to combat the virus. </p>

                        <p>It has been another amazing and successful year with many new projects and over $100,000  in  project  funding  and  surpassing  over  two  million  dollars  in  project  funding  over  the  past  forty  years.  Many  thanks  to  so  many supporters and friends who have made this possible.
