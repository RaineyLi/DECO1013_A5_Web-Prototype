                    <h1>Prema Vasam, Chennai, India.</h1>
                    <div>
                        <p>Australind has supported Prema Vasam Children’s home since 2006 Prema Vasam, meaning ‘where love resides’ in the local Tamil language, is home for children with physical and mental disability, and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. It also provides education and rehabilitation services to children from the local community. “Our home loves all children who come to our door - each and every one, no matter their disability or past trauma. We nurture what each individual child can contribute to our world through love - so that they can serve, not be served” (From the Prema Vasam website). Australind proudly supports these ideals, and assists with the many financial costs of the home, as well as funding infrastructure, maintenance and expansion projects.

                    <h1>Mithra, Chennai, India.</h1>
                   <div>  
                       <p>Australind have been supporting Mithra since 1979. In Sanskrit, ‘Mithra’ is a word meaning 'friendship'. As a home for physically and mentally challenged young people in Chennai, ‘friendship’ is a word used at Mithra to recognise, cherish and value each and every person at the home. Mithra was founded by the late Sr. Mary Theodore, an Australian nun who devoted her life to the children of Chennai. After her passing in 2014, Sr. Theodore’s legacy lives on through a committed group of Catholic nuns now running the home. Since our initial donation in 1979 for the purchase of a small ambulance to transport sick children to hospital, Australind has remained a key benefactor for Mithra, providing regular and on-going support for projects and core expenses.

                    <h1>Tibetan Childrens Home, Uttrakhand, India.</h1>
                    <div>
                        <p>Australind has been a long-time supporter of Pema Mega, a Tibetan woman who opened up her own home for Tibetan children over the past 40 years. With the help of her husband, Pema Mega established a Preparatory school situated in their home in Herbertpur, in the state of Uttrakhand, North India. Eleven children attended on the first day of school in 1982. When the number of students became too many to teach classes in their home, Pema and Mr. Mega sought to build a school on a plot of land nearby. This school is now called Johnson School, with classes to 12th standard in 2016.
